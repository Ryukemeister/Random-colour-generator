#Demo

This is a random colour generator which consist of two pages, one called simple and another one caleld hex. The simple one picks up a random colour out of five pre defined colours and changes the background everytime we click the 'CLICK ME' button. The hex one generates a random rgb hex colour from a array of elements containing numbers from 1-9 and letters from A-F and then changes background everytime the 'CLICK ME' button is clicked. I was able to create this project with the help of one of John Smilga's vidoes on 15 basic Javascript projects from YouTube.
