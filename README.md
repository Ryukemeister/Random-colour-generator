#Demo

This is a random colour generator which consist of two pages, a simple one and a hex one. The simple page picks a random colour out of four pre defined colours and changes the background everytime we click the CLICK ME button. The hex actually generates a random rgb hex colour from a list of elements contianing numbers from 1-9 and letters from A-F and then changes background everytime we click the CLICK ME button. I created this project with the help of one of John Smilga's vidoes on basic Javascript projects.
